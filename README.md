## Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) - UON
CEMA - University of Nairobi (UON) brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, clinicians, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists and data scientists using data-driven approaches to control infectious diseases and improve health in Kenya and the African Continent. It bridges disciplines across different schools within the University of Nairobi (UoN) and the private sector to deliver timely analysis to inform policy to tackle infectious diseases and improve health outcomes.

 ## CEMA Internship - Computer Science Track
 In this repo, you will find a machine learning model that I was assigned to come up with using TensorFlow.<br><br>
 OBJECTIVE<br>
 Create a machine learning model that is able to classify whether a blood smear is either uninfected or parasitized with the Plasmodium parasite.<br> 
 METHODOLOGY<br>
 1). Data Collection<br>
For this task, I used a sample* of the data (thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells) from the simplified [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) that was obtained under licenses from [The National Institutes of Health](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-downloads/downloads.html#malaria-datasets). 
 

 for any quest. email me via 


POINT TO NOTE:<br>
Sample* - In an ordered manner, only the first few images were used in this task based on the availability of computing resources (my laptop's CPU and clock speeds). Training the model with the whole set of data would require a computer with very high processing speed and power. Incase you need the whole data for that, you can obtain it from [NIH Official Website](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-research/LHC-projects/image-processing/malaria-datasheet.html)
